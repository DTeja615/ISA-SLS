# ISA-SLS-LunarLander-v2 Solver

This LunarLander-v2 Solver is a project for SELF-LEARNING SYSTEMS in National University of Singapore.

This is a project to use Reinforcement Learning and Evolutionary Algorithm to solve LunarLander-v2 problem in OpenAIGym.

## Actions

There are four discrete actions the lander can take:

0: Do nothing

1: Fire left thruster

2: Fire main thruster

3: Fire right thruster

## State

The state vector consists of eight variables between -1 and 1:

Lander position in x

Lander position in y

Lander velocity in x

Lander velocity in y

Lander angle

Lander angular velocity

Contact left landing leg

Contact right landing leg
